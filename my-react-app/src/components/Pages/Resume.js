          <p>
            As an entry-level web developer, I'm eager to find a job where I can
            use my coding and design skills. I know both front-end and back-end
            technologies well and can create websites and web applications that
            are user-friendly and look great. My goal is to make digital
            experiences that meet both user needs and business goals. I'm
            excited to take on new challenges, learn many new techniques, and
            work with others who share my passion for web development.
